# Exercise 2: Automated Planning

A partial implementation of a STRIPS-like planner in Python. The planner solves a problem based on a domain, where both the *problem* and the *domain* are defined in [PDDL 1.2](https://planning.wiki/ref/pddl). The implementation is based on [pyperplan](https://github.com/aibasel/pyperplan).

## How to run the project 
You can run the script `plan.py` with Python 3 (command python3, used afterwards, or python) for solving a problem defined in PDDL.
You can specify the following arguments:
- positional arguments:
  - `domain`: the file path of the domain defined in PDDL
  - `problem`: the file path of the problem defined in PDDL

- optional arguments:
  - `-s {astar,wastar,gbf,bfs,ehs,ids,sat}`: the search algorithm from A*, weighted A*, greedy best first, breadth first, enforced hillclimbing, iterative deepening, sat solve (default: bfs)

```
python3 plan.py [-s {astar,wastar,gbf,bfs,ehs,ids,sat}] [domain] problem
```
For example, to run the planner with the breadth-first algorithm:
```
python3 plan.py -s bfs examples/blocks-world-domain.pddl examples/blocks-world-problem.pddl
```
Or to run the planner with the A* algorithm that you implemented in Task 2 or if negations use the example:
```
python3 plan.py -s astar t1-your-domain.pddl t1-your-problem.pddl

python3 plan.py -s astar examples/blocks-world-domain.pddl examples/blocks-world-problem.pddl
```

## Task 2
- Complete the implementation of [`task.py`](task.py), which includes classes for creating Operators and STRIPS-like instances  ⟨Propositional arguments, Operators, Initial state, Goals⟩:  
     - Implement the methods `applicable()` and `apply()` of the `Operator` class
     - Implement the methods `goal_reached()` and `get_successor_states()` of the `Task` class
     - TIPS:
       - Study the class `Operator` in [`task.py`](task.py) to see how the planner should handle the removal and addition of predicates 
       - Use [Python Frozenset](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/frozenset)
       - Run your planner implementation with a search algorithm other than A* until you implement Task 2.1
       - If you didn't manage to complete Task 1, run your planner implementation with the provided [Blocks World domain and problem](examples/).
- Complete the implementation of [`a_star.py`](search/a_star.py), which includes methods for searching based on the A* search algorithm:
     - Implement the method `astar_search()`
     - TIPS: 
       - Study the class `Task` in [`task.py`](task.py) to see how the search algorithm should handle STRIPS-like planning tasks
       - Study the class `SearchNode` in [`searchspace.py`](search/searchspace.py) to see how the search algorithm should handle the nodes of the search space 
       - Use the [heapq module](https://pythontic.com/algorithms/heapq/introduction) for handling heaps in Python.
  
### Attention
The planner does not support the negation of conditions in PDDL. Therefore, you cannot use it to test your PDDL domain and problem in Task 1. Instead, you can test it on the provided example.

## Task 3
- Examine the `task-3/t3-domain.py` and the `task-3/t3-problem.py`, and the behavior of the planner when solving the problem in the domain, so that you answer the questions provided to you in the exercise sheet: 
  - [`t3-domain.pddl`](task-3/t3-domain.pddl): the domain
  - [`t3-problem.pddl`](task-3/t3-problem.pddl): the problem
  - [`t3-solution.soln`](task-3/t3-solution.soln): a solution to the problem in the domain generated with a classical STRIPS planner
